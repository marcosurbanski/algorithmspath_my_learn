Algorithms Path

This project is a personal collection of algorithms and data structures written in Python, based on problems and challenges from AlgorithmsPath.com.

The goal is to learn and implement classic algorithms while writing testable and maintainable code.

Features

📘 Clean and simple Python implementations of CS/DSA problems

🧪 Automated testing with pytest

✅ Each algorithm includes one or more test cases to verify correctness

📁 Organized by topic (sorting, recursion, trees, graphs, etc.)
